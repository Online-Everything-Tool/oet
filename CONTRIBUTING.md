## Join the OET Revolution: We're Building a Better Web, One Tool at a Time!

Are you tired of "Big Tool" shenanigans? You know the drill:

1.  🎣🌐 Grab SEO-friendly domains.
2.  🍯💸 Get users hooked on a "free" service.
3.  👀🕵️‍♂️ Start tracking everything they do.
4.  💰📈 Sell their data to the highest bidder.
5.  📢💥 Plaster sites with intrusive ads.
6.  🔒🚪 Gatekeep basic functionality behind authentication walls.

**So are we.**

Online Everything Tool (OET) is an early-stage project dedicated to being different. We're building a suite of powerful, **client-side browser utilities** with a simple promise:

- ✨ **Privacy First:** Your data is yours. We don't track you, use cookies for profiling, or sell your information. Ever.
- 🚫 **No Ads, No Nonsense:** Our tools are clean, focused, and free of advertising clutter.
- 💻 **Client-Side Power:** Most OET tools run directly in your browser, ensuring speed and keeping your data off our (or anyone else's) servers for core operations.
- 🔓 **Open & Accessible:** We believe useful tools should be free and open for everyone.

**Why Join the OET Organization on GitHub?**

We're looking for individuals to help shape OET from the ground up. By becoming an member of the Online-Everything-Tool GitHub organization, you'll gain:

- **Merge Power!** 🚀 The ability to directly review and merge Pull Requests (including those for awesome new tools, maybe even your own!). This is key to helping us grow and maintain quality.
- **Street Cred:** Okay, maybe not "street cred" in the traditional sense, but definitely "cool internet project cred" for being an early, core contributor to something awesome. 😎
