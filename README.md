# Online Everything Tool (OET)

**A versatile collection of useful online tools, accessible directly from your browser.**

OET aims to provide a single, easy-to-use interface for various common (and maybe uncommon!) tasks you might need to perform online, without needing to install separate applications.

**All tools are completely client-based**
