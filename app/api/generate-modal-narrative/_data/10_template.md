CHAPTER_EMOJI::🪣
CHAPTER_STORY::Every night I mop around the server racks. And tonight? I see someone’s spinning up a '{{TOOL_DIRECTIVE}}' on OET. Huh. Ambitious move.

CHAPTER_EMOJI::📚
CHAPTER_STORY::I read "{{TOOL_DESCRIPTION}}" scribbled on the back of a pizza box in the breakroom. Recognized it instantly—same logic I used in my unsent whitepaper.

CHAPTER_EMOJI::🧠
CHAPTER_STORY::They’re using '{{GENERATION_MODEL_NAME}}'? Not bad. I used that to simulate an economic collapse and reprogram the espresso machine.

CHAPTER_EMOJI::🔍
CHAPTER_STORY::User said: "{{USER_ADDITIONAL_DESCRIPTION}}". That’s the kind of insight you don’t get in a boardroom. That’s mop-bucket philosophy, right there.

CHAPTER_EMOJI::🛠️
CHAPTER_STORY::Examples include '{{AI_REQUESTED_EXAMPLES_LIST}}' and '{{USER_SELECTED_EXAMPLES_LIST}}'? I trained my pet ferret to recognize those structures.

CHAPTER_EMOJI::🪑
CHAPTER_STORY::Heard the execs mumbling about “competitive threats” while I fixed the breakroom stool. Funny—they never noticed I also rewrote their load balancer config.

CHAPTER_EMOJI::🧾
CHAPTER_STORY::Tool’s almost done compiling. Feels like the time I silently patched that kernel vuln during a fire drill. No one said thanks. Typical.

CHAPTER_EMOJI::☕
CHAPTER_STORY::I told Jenkins from DevOps this would happen. He laughed. Then his Slack status changed to “Out of Office – Reconsidering Career.”

CHAPTER_EMOJI::🌀
CHAPTER_STORY::It’s live. Clean interface. Smart logic. Better than anything LegacyStack’s shipped since 2007. I feel something... pride? Resentment? Acid reflux?

CHAPTER_EMOJI::🚪
CHAPTER_STORY::Anyway, I left a full architecture review under the floor tile labeled “M2-BETA.” If OET needs a janitor with a secret PhD and a vendetta—I’m available.
