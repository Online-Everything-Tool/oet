CHAPTER_EMOJI::üòí
CHAPTER_STORY::Ticket #8675309: 'OET building a '{{TOOL_DIRECTIVE}}'.' Great. Another client-side thing. Means less for me to patch at 3 AM, I guess.
--END_CHAPTER--

CHAPTER_EMOJI::üôÑ
CHAPTER_STORY::Description: '{{TOOL_DESCRIPTION}}'. Bet it'll still find a way to crash Chrome if you look at it funny. Users, eh?
--END_CHAPTER--

CHAPTER_EMOJI::‚öôÔ∏è
CHAPTER_STORY::Model '{{GENERATION_MODEL_NAME}}'? As long as it doesn't try to 'learn' our network topology, fine. Last AI tried to optimize our cooling by opening a window. In a blizzard.
--END_CHAPTER--

CHAPTER_EMOJI::üöß
CHAPTER_STORY::User 'refined' it with '{{USER_ADDITIONAL_DESCRIPTION}}'. Probably wants it to integrate with their smart toaster now. Scope creep, always.
--END_CHAPTER--
--START_CHAPTER--
CHAPTER_EMOJI::üîß
CHAPTER_STORY::Referenced '{{AI_REQUESTED_EXAMPLES_LIST}}' and '{{USER_SELECTED_EXAMPLES_LIST}}'. If they copy that janky JavaScript from 'old-tool-x', so help me...
--END_CHAPTER--

CHAPTER_EMOJI::üí£
CHAPTER_STORY::If this '{{TOOL_DIRECTIVE}}' actually works well, management will ask why \_our* '{{TOOL_DIRECTIVE}}'-equivalent requires a mainframe and three sacrifices to the beige box gods.
--END*CHAPTER--
--START_CHAPTER--
CHAPTER_EMOJI::‚è≥
CHAPTER_STORY::Processing. Probably chewing up CPU cycles on some poor dev's machine. At least it's not \_my* servers... yet.
--END_CHAPTER--

CHAPTER_EMOJI::üí°
CHAPTER_STORY::Hold on, if OET's '{{TOOL_DIRECTIVE}}' is all client-side, and good... maybe I can finally retire that ancient PERL script that does something vaguely similar for HR.
--END_CHAPTER--
--START_CHAPTER--
CHAPTER_EMOJI::üëÄ
CHAPTER_STORY::Hmm, if OET is this efficient with their '{{TOOL_DIRECTIVE}}', I wonder what their server uptime is like... and if they need any grumpy, over-qualified sysadmins.
--END_CHAPTER--
--START_CHAPTER--
CHAPTER_EMOJI::üö™
CHAPTER_STORY::Yeah, OET, if your '{{TOOL_DIRECTIVE}}' can run without a daily reboot, you might be my new favorite. Got any openings for someone who speaks fluent Regex and sarcasm?
