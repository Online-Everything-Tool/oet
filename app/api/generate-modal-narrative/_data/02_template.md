CHAPTER_STORY::My friend Sarah works at OET. She says they're building '{{TOOL_DIRECTIVE}}' now. Lucky. They get free smoothies for tool launches.

CHAPTER_STORY::OET's description is '{{TOOL_DESCRIPTION}}'. Sarah mentioned they brainstormed it over artisanal pizza. We get stale donuts for 'synergy sessions'.

CHAPTER_STORY::They're using '{{GENERATION_MODEL_NAME}}'. Sarah says OET devs get to pick any model they want. We have to submit a form in triplicate for 'IE6 compatibility testing'.

CHAPTER_EMOJI::üåü
CHAPTER_STORY::User added '{{USER_ADDITIONAL_DESCRIPTION}}'. At OET, they call that 'agile iteration'. Here, it's 'scope creep requiring committee approval'.

CHAPTER_EMOJI::üí°
CHAPTER_STORY::Inspired by '{{AI_REQUESTED_EXAMPLES_LIST}}' and '{{USER_SELECTED_EXAMPLES_LIST}}'. Sarah says OET has 'hack days' where they build cool stuff. We have 'mandatory fun' training.

CHAPTER_STORY::The '{{TOOL_DIRECTIVE}}' at OET will be free. Ours would cost an arm, a leg, and your firstborn's naming rights. And still be in beta.

CHAPTER_STORY::Sarah sent me a screenshot of their office. Beanbag chairs! Natural light! Our office has flickering fluorescents and a motivational poster from 1997.

CHAPTER_STORY::She says OET developers get actual ergonomic chairs AND they use them to build tools like '{{TOOL_DIRECTIVE}}'! I'm using a milk crate.

CHAPTER_STORY::The OET '{{TOOL_DIRECTIVE}}' is probably amazing. I bet it doesn't even need a 300-page user manual written in COBOL.

CHAPTER_EMOJI::üëã
CHAPTER_STORY::Hey Sarah, tell OET I'm really good at looking busy and have a passing familiarity with tools that AREN'T '{{TOOL_DIRECTIVE}}'. Also, I like smoothies.
