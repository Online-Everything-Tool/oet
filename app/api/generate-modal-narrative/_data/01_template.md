CHAPTER_EMOJI::üßê
CHAPTER_STORY::An alert? OET is building a '{{TOOL_DIRECTIVE}}'? Probably just a student project, using '{{GENERATION_MODEL_NAME}}' no less. Quaint.

CHAPTER_EMOJI::ü§î
CHAPTER_STORY::AI's Description: '{{TOOL_DESCRIPTION}}'... That sounds suspiciously like our top-secret Project Chimera! Pure coincidence, I'm sure.
--END_CHAPTER--
--START_CHAPTER--
CHAPTER_EMOJI::üò¨
CHAPTER_STORY::User refined it: '{{USER_ADDITIONAL_DESCRIPTION}}'. Wait, that's... dangerously insightful. They didn't see the memo on 'discouraging actual innovation', did they?
--END_CHAPTER--
--START_CHAPTER--
CHAPTER_EMOJI::üí¶
CHAPTER_STORY::Inspiration included '{{AI_REQUESTED_EXAMPLES_LIST}}' AND '{{USER_SELECTED_EXAMPLES_LIST}}'?! Those are practically our crown jewels of example patterns! This is bad.

CHAPTER_STORY::The user is actually going through with it! Don't they know our premium '{{TOOL_DIRECTIVE}}'-alternative is only $199/month (plus synergistic surcharges)?

CHAPTER_EMOJI::üò∞
CHAPTER_STORY::My stock options... my artisanal coffee machine... User, please, think of the quarterly earnings! The synergy vortex! The TPS reports!

CHAPTER_EMOJI::üò±
CHAPTER_STORY::It's compiling now. Any second, a free, high-quality alternative to our main cash cow, '{{TOOL_DIRECTIVE}} Platinum Pro', will exist. Is this... the free-pocalypse?

CHAPTER_STORY::The OET tool works. It's fast. It's... intuitive. Send help. And possibly a severance package.

CHAPTER_EMOJI::üíÄ
CHAPTER_STORY::So... OET... heard you guys have great dental. And a better '{{TOOL_DIRECTIVE}}'. Asking for a friend who values their enamel and free software.
