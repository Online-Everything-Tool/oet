CHAPTER_STORY::I hear a little operation called OET is building a '{{TOOL_DIRECTIVE}}'. Cute. Real cute. Like a cockroach tryin‚Äô to unionize the kitchen.

CHAPTER_EMOJI::üçù
CHAPTER_STORY::They describe it like this: "{{TOOL_DESCRIPTION}}". That‚Äôs our turf. We got three shadow LLCs extorting monthly fees off that exact utility.

CHAPTER_EMOJI::üßÑ
CHAPTER_STORY::Model in use? '{{GENERATION_MODEL_NAME}}'? Back in my day, we did machine learning with a crowbar and a spreadsheet. Now this AI thinks it‚Äôs smarter than me?
--END_CHAPTER--
--START_CHAPTER--
CHAPTER_EMOJI::ü•ñ
CHAPTER_STORY::User refinement says: "{{USER_ADDITIONAL_DESCRIPTION}}". That‚Äôs suspiciously elegant. We got guys in QA that haven‚Äôt formed a full sentence in 12 years.
--END_CHAPTER--
--START_CHAPTER--
CHAPTER_EMOJI::üßä
CHAPTER_STORY::They‚Äôre using '{{AI_REQUESTED_EXAMPLES_LIST}}' AND '{{USER_SELECTED_EXAMPLES_LIST}}'? That's a double-cross. That‚Äôs what that is. We own those inspiration routes.

CHAPTER_EMOJI::‚öñÔ∏è
CHAPTER_STORY::Do they know we offer '{{TOOL_DIRECTIVE}} Premium Maximus' for $149.99 a month, no refunds, ever? We got contracts older than their founders.

CHAPTER_STORY::The tool's working. I sent Tony "The Modal" to click around, and he said it was ‚Äúsnappy.‚Äù He hasn‚Äôt said anything was snappy since 2011.

CHAPTER_EMOJI::üö¨
CHAPTER_STORY::This ain‚Äôt just competition. This is insubordination. We built an empire on slow load times and feature bloat. And they... optimized it.

CHAPTER_EMOJI::üëû
CHAPTER_STORY::They call it user-friendly. I call it... disrespectful. What‚Äôs next, free API access? We used to charge for breathing near the dashboard.

CHAPTER_EMOJI::üï≥Ô∏è
CHAPTER_STORY::If anyone asks, I always respected OET. Just in case. But between you and me? We‚Äôre sending a very polite cease-and-desist made of concrete.
