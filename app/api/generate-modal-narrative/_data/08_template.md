CHAPTER_STORY::Listen Marty, it’s Brantley. OET’s doing a friends and family round valued at $2M. That includes Aunt Karen, and she doesn’t even own a computer.

CHAPTER_EMOJI::📊
CHAPTER_STORY::OET just raised a Series A at $22.5M with '{{TOOL_DIRECTIVE}}' in the picture. This thing’s got legs, Marty. Legs, wings, and possibly self-awareness.

CHAPTER_STORY::Marty. Brantley again. They closed Series B at $85M. They're describing '{{TOOL_DESCRIPTION}}' like it’s the second coming of sliced APIs.

CHAPTER_STORY::We offered to lead a Series D. They replied with a sticker of a raccoon on a rocket ship and the phrase “access denied, legacy VC.”

CHAPTER_STORY::I tried to email them. The response was a poem written in Python. It rhymed and benchmarked faster than our portfolio average.

CHAPTER_STORY::Anyway, Marty, if you hear of any seed-stage AI marketplaces run by time-traveling baristas or sentient toasters... call me. I’m liquidating my standing desk.
