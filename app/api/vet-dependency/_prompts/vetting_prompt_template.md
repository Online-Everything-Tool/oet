Analyze the NPM package `{{PACKAGE_NAME}}`. It is being considered as a dependency for a client-side browser-based utility tool called '{{TOOL_DIRECTIVE}}' whose function is described as: "{{TOOL_DESCRIPTION}}".

The project this tool belongs to ("Online Everything Tool") has a strict rule: **individual tools MUST NOT make external network calls** (e.g., to third-party APIs, CDNs for dynamic data/scripts, or for analytics/telemetry) for their core runtime functionality. All tool functionality must be self-contained in the browser after initial page load and contained to the local domain for any resource fetching.

However, some libraries require static assets that are hosted locally within the project with paths like `/data/{{TOOL_DIRECTIVE}}/assets/` or similar. The tool's client-side code would then fetch these assets ONLY from these local project paths.

The following "Asset Instructions" have been provided by the developer of the tool's code. These instructions if present indicate how such local assets are intended to be used with this tool.
